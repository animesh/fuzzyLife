I am trying to develop an Artificial Intelligence powered system to augment doctors in interpreting symptoms, 
checkout [checkup](https://boiling-journey-36115.herokuapp.com/) with input like "I am having fever"... 

### eventually the plan is to fit in data backed by demographic history

```markdown
- probabilistic diagnosis, specifically, interpret lab tests and imaging results coming from suspected infectious disease and risk assessment of other conditions e.g. cancer

- able to integrate into available health infrastructure via API(s)

- locally sourced data, predicting an outbreak, aiding resource allocation;add Bhojpuri/Hindi to aid urban and rural health care providers respectively
```
